# Raises the alerts that show up in the merchant's bell menu.

# Design rules kept deliberately tight, because an inbox that cries wolf gets
# ignored and then the one alert that mattered is missed too:
#   * only things the merchant can DO something about
#   * never one alert per transaction — repeats collapse on `dedup_key`
#   * a failure here must never break the customer action that triggered it
