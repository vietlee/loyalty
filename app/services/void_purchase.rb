# Undo a bill that was rung up wrong (double tap, an extra zero, wrong customer).

# The ledger stays append-only: we never delete the original "earn" row, we post
# a mirroring negative "void" row so the customer's history shows what happened.
# The Purchase itself is flagged (not destroyed) so it drops out of every revenue
# and visit report while the audit trail survives.
#
# Gamification is rolled back on a best-effort basis (see Gamification.reverse_purchase):
# stamps and in-progress missions come back down, but a reward already issued and
# possibly already used is never clawed back.
